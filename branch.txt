Branch

A branch can be imagined as a separate timeline. When git is initialised in a
directory, commits are made to the default branch "master", which can be 
considered to be the main time line of the project. It is possible to create
a new branch where all your work and all of your commits will have no bearing
 on the master branch. When you are finished working on your current timeline,
 you can merge your branch to another branch or back to the master. This is 
 useful if you go back in time to the 1920's and want to bring back a lovely
 new hat. If only git were invented back then.
 
 Merging is the process by which two branches are combined - there can be 
 some friction at this stage as the two alternate realities may not agree 
 with each other 100%. Therefore you may encounter conflicts which will need 
 to be resolved before the next commit.
