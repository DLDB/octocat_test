Upstream Remote

The 'upstream' remote, in its most basic form  refers to a repository stored
on a server. The term is often used to indicate the main online repository. 
For example, a user may have forked a repository into their github and then 
cloned to their local machine. They would do  general development in their 
own repo, and could periodically merge to the main upstream remote. This 
would help to keep their work clean and secure, without making changes to the
main project until all changes have been agreed.
