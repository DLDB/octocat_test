Git Clone

The command "git clone (repo)" creates a complete local copy of a repository.

When used from the command line, it will create a folder in your pwd
with the same name as the repo you are cloning. The contents of the repo
will be placed inside that folder.

In addition to this, the folder will be an initialised git repository, and 
the default branch (usually "master") and remote name "origin" will be added.
The remote will be set up as the URL you cloned from.
